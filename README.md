This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Starting with docker
1. DEV MODE only

Inside the the app folder (techtime_app), You will find the dockerfile image instructions,Plase don't edit unless if needs be.

2. Inside the root folder you can find the yaml file where every instruction has been assembled on how docker should build our container images,Please don't edit unless if needs be.

3. Starting project in dev mode with docker use this command to spin it up as ports has been mapped to [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004)

```bash
docker-compose up
```
